This is a portfolio project that I created using React, NodeJS, and TailwindCSS. This project helped me learn how to deploy a website 
and familiarize myself with React, NodeJS and TailwindCSS. I wrote the project in a virtual machine with Ubuntu using WSL. This project
is not yet complete but it is what I call a minimum-viable-product, and that is good enough for me.
